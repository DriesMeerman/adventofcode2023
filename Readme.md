# Advent of codd 2023
This year I'm using Swift as a language to do the challenges.
I'm using Foundation which are apple platform specific so you will need a macbook to run the code.


## Requirements
- MacOS
- A folder `inputs` containing your input of the day in the file format dayN.txt

See also the `inputFilePath` variables in each challenge.

## Usage

From a terminal in the rootfolder of the project run the following:
`swift run aoc2023`
